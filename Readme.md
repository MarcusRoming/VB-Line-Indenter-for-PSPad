VB-Line Indenter for PSPad Editor
=================================

Very simple VB-Script code beautifier for PSPad. By Marcus Roming, using some code of "gogogadgetscott". 

Installation: Copy into the PSPad installation path into the folder "\Script\VBScript\". Only copy the "VBIndent.vbs" script file! 
The function can then be found via the Script-menu: "Script/Format code/VBIndent". If not available activate WSH Scripting in the PSPad settings.

Known issues:
- has difficulties to interpret multi line commands (using "_")
- Does not like missing spaces before an "Then" and multi spaces in some expressions (like in "End  Function"). 

Use at your own risk!
